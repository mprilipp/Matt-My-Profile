										<h3>Personal Information</h3>
										<p>I was born and raised in Germany close to Cologne and near the Netherlands boarder. Germany is exactly the way you would expect it to be and I have grown up adopting the German Punctuality and “No Small Talk” philosophy. After school, social service and a 2 years apprenticeship at a media agency in Dusseldorf, I started my Bachelor degree in Stuttgart, the German capital for automotive. During my studies I completed an internship in the marketing department of a sports cars manufacturer in Stuttgart and started to work for the company as a student trainee part time. After completing my degree I spend 6 months backpacking in New Zealand before I commenced my Master of Commerce (Major Marketing) at Deakin University, Melbourne.</p>
										<p>Completing my Master degree and another international internship at a regional office of the sports cars manufacturer in Prag, Czech Republic, I finally returned back to Stuttgart to start my full time employment in Marketing Strategy. After 2 years at head office I followed my desire to work abroad and moved to Australia to work for the same company as a Product Manager, New Technologies. Interesting fact: I’m a family person with a great passion for football and Crossfit! I even attended several Crossfit competitions around Melbourne, but unfortunately never made it to the actual <a href="https://games.crossfit.com">Crossfit Games</a>.</p>

									<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
									<p>My interest in IT is based on my professional background. The automotive industry is currently undergoing the biggest transformation in history and manufacturers as well as suppliers have to rethink their business paradigms including product strategy, sales channels, customer communication, UX/UI and the slow transition to connected, autonomous, shared and electric mobility. This transformation has started several years ago and is now reaching the stage where it is not just a marginal movement but a tremendous shift in the industry. Therefore, with this development in mind, I have decided to add a new set of skills to my repertoire and study IT. The introduction will give me a broader understanding of the industry which I would like to follow up with another specialization in web development.</p>
									<p>I chose RMIT because of the tremendous reputation and the option with this course to study very flexible in an online environment. Due to my full time employment commitments, there was no other option for me to take this first steps into the world of IT. With this course I hope to get a better understanding of the overall IT landscape. In addition to that, a completely new topic helps seeing things from a different perspective and I hope this will majorly benefit my project management and leadership skills for future digital projects and tasks.</p>

										<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
										<p>My ideal job is similar to the job advertisement that I have selected <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39802096?searchrequesttoken=03e5e535-e130-4b9f-95ad-5969f8a83944&type=standout">[Ideal Job]</a>. The position as a Head/Director of Digital Marketing and e-Commerce is responsible for the digital sales funnel across all business units and is expected to grow the funnel by using digital tools and technologies while engaging with customers as well as internal stakeholders. The rise of the digital sales funnel and the offering of online services will slowly enter the automotive industry with in-vehicle connectivity service offerings already available on subscription based models. This development fascinates me as I foresee, as many others, the emergence of the vehicle as the autonomous digital companion that allows us to efficiently use our travel time by accessing a vast array of online services. To define digital product portfolios and develop marketing strategies that leverage digital tools to strengthen customer loyalty and enhance the customer experience are two main areas that I want to focus on in my future career.</p>
										<p>The skills required for a position like this and my current statusregarding my personal skill set are outlined in the table below:</p>
										<table style="width:100%">
  										<tr>
    										<th>Qualifications, Skills and Experience Required</th>
    										<th>Qualifications, Skills and Experience Held    </th> 
  										</tr>
  										<tr>
    										<td>Tertiary qualification in business, marketing, commerce</td>
    										<td>Master of Commerce, Marketing </td>
  										</tr>
  										<tr>
    										<td>Proven management skills, with ability to deliver multiple projects concurrently</td>
    										<td>Rollout of major projects in digital area</td>
  										</tr>
										<tr>
    										<td>Have an obsession for perfecting the customer journey experience</td>
    										<td>Current projects in-vehicle connectivity / customer portal require perfecting the customer journey</td>
  										</tr>	
										<tr>
    										<td>Demonstrated ability to develop comprehensive digital marketing & communications plans, and translate them into day-to-day activities</td>
    										<td>Marketing Plan development on a smaller scale</td>
  										</tr>	
										<tr>
    										<td>Enjoy a fast paced, proactive work environment with clear directives and KPIs</td>
    										<td>Yes, certainly </td>
  										</tr>
										<tr>
    										<td>5+ years hands-on experience in a similar digital role and also in e-commerce marketing</td>
    										<td>Currently, 2 years digital role</td>
  										</tr>
										<tr>
    										<td>Ability to balance short-term sales with longer term strategic goals and bridge the gap between marketing, technology and department heads</td>
    										<td>Little experience in sales yet, however, involved in company strategy</td>
  										</tr>
										<tr>
    										<td>Expert level ads manager in FB, Google Analytics, FB analytics, email marketing, website optimization & customer experience software</td>
    										<td>No experience record available</td>
  										</tr>
										<tr>
    										<td>Ability to use a variety of web development and graphic design tools (HTML, Adobe suite, Google Analytics, content management systems) is a must</td>
    										<td>No experience record available</td>
  										</tr>
										</table>
										<p>To obtain the missing skills I will continue working in my current area which covers digital technologies, app strategies, customer sales funnel and partly e-commerce to get a better understanding of the fundamentals. In addition to that, I will further engage in cross-departmental projects with a strong focus on the Sales/CRM area to further improve my understanding of the sales funnel and digital sales strategies including new digital customer journeys. On the technical side I will use this “Introduction to IT” course to get a better understanding of all the different tools available before selecting courses that specialize in Google/FB Analytics, Search and Website Optimization and Customer Experience Software as the main three areas. A further interest in an advanced degree in Web Development to gain a deep level understanding of HTML, Adobe Suite and Content Management systems will hopefully round up my profile in order to qualify for a position like this in the next 3 years.</p>

									<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
									<p>The test results below confirm the feedback that I have been given throughout my career. However, seeing the results makes me better understand my strengths and weaknesses. In particular the result of the Myers-Briggs test has given me a lot more details about my strengths and weaknesses which I will definitely be able to leverage from going forward. Regarding working in a team environment two comments in the results of the Myers-Briggs test have struck me the most.</p>
									<p>“INFPs are capable of inspiring people to develop their abilities and talents.”</p>
									<p>This comment gives me confidence that I can be in a leader role in a team environment as it is of utmost importance for a successful team in my opinion to be led by someone who can inspire and convey a vision. On the other hand, the following description made me re-think my approach in certain team situations.</p>
									<p>“However, at times INFPs can come across as distant and reserved. Those are the periods when they reflect on their views of the world and people.”</p>
									<p>In order to keep my team engaged and motivated I will have to share insights into myself with others, rather than hiding away or keeping my views of the world to myself. I have learned in my rather young career that transparency is key in order to lead respectfully and mentor young talents.</p>
									<p>In the process of forming a team I should focus on the following key factors. As a creative mind I do have to share my visions with my team from the start and be as open-minded as possible in order to gain their full trust and commitment. Furthermore, in the process of forming a team I should make sure to include people that can challenge my ideas and help me further develop them into tangible outcomes as this can be another struggle for an INFP. In the end, I should leverage from my talent to inspire people and guide the team in the way I feel is beneficial for the overall outcome. By motivating individual team members and pointing out their strengths I will be able to achieve the most impactful outcome.</p>
