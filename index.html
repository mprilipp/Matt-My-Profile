										<h3>Personal Information</h3>
										<p>I was born and raised in Germany close to Cologne and near the Netherlands boarder. Germany is exactly the way you would expect it to be and I have grown up adopting the German Punctuality and “No Small Talk” philosophy. After school, social service and a 2 years apprenticeship at a media agency in Dusseldorf, I started my Bachelor degree in Stuttgart, the German capital for automotive. During my studies I completed an internship in the marketing department of a sports cars manufacturer in Stuttgart and started to work for the company as a student trainee part time. After completing my degree I spend 6 months backpacking in New Zealand before I commenced my Master of Commerce (Major Marketing) at Deakin University, Melbourne.</p>
										<p>Completing my Master degree and another international internship at a regional office of the sports cars manufacturer in Prag, Czech Republic, I finally returned back to Stuttgart to start my full time employment in Marketing Strategy. After 2 years at head office I followed my desire to work abroad and moved to Australia to work for the same company as a Product Manager, New Technologies.  
Interesting fact: I’m a family person with a great passion for football and Crossfit! I even attended several Crossfit competitions around Melbourne, but unfortunately never made it to the actual <a href="https://games.crossfit.com">Crossfit Games</a>.</p>

									<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
									<p>My interest in IT is based on my professional background. The automotive industry is currently undergoing the biggest transformation in history and manufacturers as well as suppliers have to rethink their business paradigms including product strategy, sales channels, customer communication, UX/UI and the slow transition to connected, autonomous, shared and electric mobility. This transformation has started several years ago and is now reaching the stage where it is not just a marginal movement but a tremendous shift in the industry. Therefore, with this development in mind, I have decided to add a new set of skills to my repertoire and study IT. The introduction will give me a broader understanding of the industry which I would like to follow up with another specialization in web development.</p>
									<p>I chose RMIT because of the tremendous reputation and the option with this course to study very flexible in an online environment. Due to my full time employment commitments, there was no other option for me to take this first steps into the world of IT. With this course I hope to get a better understanding of the overall IT landscape. In addition to that, a completely new topic helps seeing things from a different perspective and I hope this will majorly benefit my project management and leadership skills for future digital projects and tasks.</p>

										<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
										<p>My ideal job is similar to the job advertisement that I have selected [Inlcude Link to ad]. The position as a Head/Director of Digital Marketing and e-Commerce is responsible for the digital sales funnel across all business units and is expected to grow the funnel by using digital tools and technologies while engaging with customers as well as internal stakeholders. The rise of the digital sales funnel and the offering of online services will slowly enter the automotive industry with in-vehicle connectivity service offerings already available on subscription based models. This development fascinates me as I foresee, as many others, the emergence of the vehicle as the autonomous digital companion that allows us to efficiently use our travel time by accessing a vast array of online services. To define digital product portfolios and develop marketing strategies that leverage digital tools to strengthen customer loyalty and enhance the customer experience are two main areas that I want to focus on in my future career.</p>
