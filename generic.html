								<h1>Project Idea</h1>
								<p>SMATRA - The App that will solve traffic congestion.</p>
							</header>

									<h3>Overview</h3>
									<p>The project idea for the group work in the course “Introduction to IT” is based on my current role in the automotive industry and deals with the topic smart mobility. The goal is to develop an App (iOS) that combines a loyalty program, similar to flybuys or velocity, with a mobility tool to incentivize the use of public modes of transportation or the use of toll roads outside of peak hour traffic in order to ease traffic congestion around major arteries of Australian capital cities. The App requires a very integrated approach tapping into third party applications like Toll Road, Public Transport or Parking Apps.</p>
									<h3>Motivation</h3>
									<p>The motivation for this project stems from my interest in smart mobility solutions and the strong belief that city ecosystems will have to change dramatically in order to maintain livable conditions in the face of growing populations, inefficient and old transportation networks as well as an increasing number of vehicles emitting CO2 and thereby posing a health risk. The issue has major implications on cities like Melbourne and is therefore in the focus of the public eye.
“Traffic congestion is one of the most significant challenges facing our cities. Melbourne’s population is growing by around 325 people a day and is projected to overtake Sydney’s within a decade. Identified as the most congested city in the country, this was a factor in Melbourne losing its seven-year grip on the “world’s most liveable city” title last year.” (Misha Ketchell 2019)</p>

									<h3>Description</h3>
									<p>The App is called SMATRA which stands for smart traffic. The overall goal of the App is to make travel around the city smarter by gamifying the experience of the everyday commute. Travelers and/or commuters can accumulate points by using different modes of transportation. As an example, if the customer links his/her Linkt account to the App the App detects when the commute occurred. If the event happened outside of the peak period 6:00 – 9:30 AM the customer will accumulate points. If no commute is detected on traffic heavy days, due to the customer avoiding toll roads or leaving the vehicle at home, booster points will increase the points balance significantly. 
</p>
									<p>The points balance allows the customer to achieve different membership status like silver, gold or platinum which will give them access to further benefits like accessing certain fast traffic lanes or premium carparks at public events or free train/tram access for a certain period of time. The App would follow a very similar structure to already existing loyalty program Apps with a navigation bar at the bottom and the current points status at the top. The navigation at the bottom is divided in “Home”, “Activity“, “My Account”, “Settings”.</p>
									<p>The “Home” menu gives the customer an overview about the current point status, the current membership status, what programs the customer is currently enlisted in (i.e. Linkt account for toll roads or Myki Card) and which special offer he has currently activated (i.e. Use of toll roads outside of peak hour for 1 months) to achieve rewards points.</>
									<p>The “Activity” menu lists the customer activities in the different modes of transportation. If not automatically captured by linked accounts the customer also has the option to scan receipts as proof of activity or to reclaim points. The list view shows the transport mode, the transaction date, the amount spent and the points that have been awarded.</p>
									<p>The “My Account” menu features the account details of the customer and gives further information on the contact methods and personal details including registered vehicles or myki cards or other accounts that qualify and link to this App. It will also give the user the option to transfer points to other loyalty programs or receive a cash payout.</p>
									<p>Under “Settings” the user is able to adjust general settings like privacy, notifications and or password information. It also allows to log out of the App and gives the customer access to an FAQ as well as a support hotline. Lastly, for the legal purposes the App includes Terms of use as well as a privacy policy to inform the customer about the fact that the data collected is used to further improve traffic congestion as well as for marketing purposes by third parties.</p>
									<p>The App is available in the App store for iOS devices only in the first instance. A membership card can be ordered for a small donation to support other related projects.</p>
									<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
									<p>According to AWS you need the following to develop an iOS App.</p>
									<p>“To develop iOS apps, you need a Mac computer running the latest version of Xcode. Xcode is Apple’s IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for both Mac and iOS apps. Xcode is the graphical interface you'll use to write iOS apps. Xcode includes the iOS SDK, tools, compilers, and frameworks you need specifically to design, develop, write code, and debug an app for iOS. For native mobile app development on iOS, Apple suggests using the modern Swift programming language. It is important to note that Xcode only runs on Mac OS X and the only supported way to develop iOS apps.” (Amazon Web Services 2019)</p>	
									<h3>Skills Required</h3>
									<p>The skills required to write the software is learning the Swift programming language and familiarise myself with the iOS SDK tools. Furthermore, there will be a lot of stakeholder management involved getting the right partners and cities on board. I foresee this actually as the main hurdle as the data has to be supplied mostly from third party companies like Linkt or Myki and a strong rewards points system has to be established in order to give customers a reason to use the platform. Lastly, the project also required solid marketing knowledge on how to promote and advertise an application like that and make it visible in Search engines like Google. Knowing the search algorithms for Google as well as in the Apple App store is key to success.</p>
									<h3>Outcome</h3>
									<p>The complexity in finding the right partners for a project like this might make it very susceptible to failure, however, with the right team and creative ideas, this app could change one of the biggest issues in modern society and help people to make their cities more liveable again. By taking off the pressure of our current traffic network and shifting demand away from peak travel times traffic congestion is predicted to ease significantly. A strong adoption of the app among citizens might also educate younger generations on smarter mobility and lead to a cultural change towards more flexible work/life balance.</p>
